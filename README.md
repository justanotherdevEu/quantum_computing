It's my final university project on quantum computing applied to cryptography. Virtually all of these are internet quotes from studies, research, scientific and engineering publications. All acknowledgements are mentioned at the end in the bibliography section. This paper is written in Spanish, but you can translate online with deepl.com / others.
